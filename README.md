# About

Semi disorganised collection of Hammerspoon utilities.  Not written as spoons.

# Featured

Here are the ones that I use the most:

* menuKeys - provides a windows-like alt+hotkey popup for Mac applications
* espresso - an upgrade of the classic Hammerspoon don't-sleep code that provides other useful display functions
* appLauncher - binds function keys to launch applications
* finderTabs - organises a number of Finder windows along the bottom of the screen like Macs of olde
* stack - todo app that cpatures the current window, useful for coding workflows where you dig into rabbit holes

Others that are useful but get less air time:

* midiHelper - connect midi controllers and synthesizers
* textCase - provides common text transformations
* userProfiler - keeps a log of the current window
* winDebug - shows information about Mac windows

# Using These

A few points about using these:
* they rely on the SF Fonts being loaded to give the various icons
* my hyper key set up maps caps lock to cmd+ctrl+opt.  I use another utility for this
* these apps typically install in the menubar and as pop-ups
